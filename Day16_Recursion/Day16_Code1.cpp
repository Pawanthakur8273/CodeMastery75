# Recursion Programs in C++

This repository contains C++ implementations of common algorithms using recursion. Each program solves a specific problem using recursive methods.

## Programs Included:

1. **Factorial Calculation**
   - Computes the factorial of a number using recursion.
   - Function: `factorial(int n)`
   - Base case: `factorial(0) = 1`, `factorial(1) = 1`
   
2. **Print Numbers from n to 1**
   - Recursively prints numbers from `n` down to `1`.
   - Function: `print(int n)`
   - Base case: Prints `1` and terminates.
   
3. **Power of Two**
   - Calculates `2^n` using recursion.
   - Function: `pow(int n)`
   - Base case: `pow(0) = 1`
   
4. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Recursively calculates the `n`th Fibonacci number.
   - Function: `fib(int n)`
   - Base case: `fib(0) = 0`, `fib(1) = 1`
   
5. **Sum of First n Natural Numbers**
   - Computes the sum of the first `n` natural numbers recursively.
   - Function: `sum(int n)`
   - Base case: `sum(1) = 1`

## How to Run:
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Recursion-Programs.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the directory:
    ```bash
    cd Recursion-Programs
    ```
3. Compile and run the program:
    ```bash
    g++ recursion.cpp -o recursion
    ./recursion
    ```

## Usage:
Uncomment the specific function calls in the `main()` function to test different programs.
